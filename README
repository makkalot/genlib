== genlib

genlib is a very simple library (actually a dsl ) which aim is to make the process of making
generators very easy. The idea was to have a simple interface like Python's yield generator 
interface.

You define a generator like :

require 'genlib'

generator :read_array do |obj|
  (1..10).each do |e|
    obj._yield e
  end
end


And you then can use it like a regular iterator

for elem in generator(:read_array)
  puts "The element is : #{elem}"
end
